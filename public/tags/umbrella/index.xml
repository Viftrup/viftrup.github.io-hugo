<p>It introduces an efficient protection/enforcement of security and policies, with relatively low “time-to-action”</p>
<p>Especially Cisco Umbrella which offers a range of DNS protection mechanisms does this very well - however there is a lot of different vendors which provides this kind of protection. (NGFWs might also be able to do parts of this)</p>]]></description>
