Blocking specific internet categories or malicious activity based on DNS is becoming more popular, and often requires very little effort by the IT-department to implement.

  

It introduces an efficient protection/enforcement of security and policies, with relatively low “time-to-action”

  

  

Especially Cisco Umbrella which offers a range of DNS protection mechanisms does this very well - however there is a lot of different vendors which provides this kind of protection. (NGFWs might also be able to do parts of this)
